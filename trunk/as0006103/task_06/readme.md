***Goal:***
Study proposed projects and contribute to the project (in the form of submitting questions via issues and making changes via pull request)
<br><br><br>

## Progress
During the study of the proposed projects, a command was added to the documentation of one of them to clone the repository in readme.md for convenient use. I created an issue in which I pointed out the [issue](https://github.com/savushkin-r-d/EasyEPLANner/issues/1275). Created a [pull request](https://github.com/savushkin-r-d/EasyEPLANner/pull/1276) in which he mentioned the issue that he was fixing.
